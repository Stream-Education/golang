# Introduction

Welcome to our onboarding documentation for the Go programming language, aka "golang".

As Stream, we want to onboard our engineering team with content that is easy to find, easy to understand, and get up to speed as effectively as possible.

### What to Expect

We've written our documentation in three phases:

1. Must-have: these are the core foundations we need you to understand about this subject matter.
2. Should-have: the content here will make you a very effective member of our team
3. Nice-to-have: if you know and understand these principles you're going to be an outstanding teammate!

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to our documentation, you are welcome to do so. We are not looking to write a whole new book on this subject, so please keep that in mind. We also have a page on how to contribute:

### Onboarding for Go

Go is a great programming language. We migrated our code from Python to Go in 2017 and our team has seen incredible performance boosts.
