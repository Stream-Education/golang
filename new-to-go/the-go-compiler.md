# The Go Compiler

### Learning Goals

* basic usage of the Go command-line compiler, common switches and settings

### Background

Since Go is a compiled language, your code will need to compile error-free in order to execute your code.

### Content

Give your Code a test-run

```text
go run main.go
```

This will execute your code and show you any output.

Special Things to Note:

* your code will not compile if:
  * you import a module and do not use it
  * you declare a variable and do not use it
  * 
*
