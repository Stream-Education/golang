# Introduction to Go

This area of content will introduce you to the Go programming language and teach you the basics that we need you to understand here at Stream.

This will not replace other online documentation and may link to other documentation and other content that the team has found helpful.

### Learning Goals

The goal of this whole section is to form a learning platform for you to get up to speed quickly on the basics of the Go programming language so you can get up to speed quickly on the team.

### Background

We transitioned to Go in 2017 as an organization and haven't looked back. Our developers need to be effective at Go in a short amount of time, so we have condensed this into a "must-know" catalog of documents.

### Content

If you expand this page section in the menu to the left, you will see a large list of documents. We have written this content and organized it into the order that you should consume the content.

### Conclusion

We believe in your career and we're investing time into you as an employee to make you effective.

You have a large team around you who also want to see you succeed and grow. Please ask questions. You are not bothering anyone when you are asking questions. **It is an expected part of our teamwork and company culture.**
