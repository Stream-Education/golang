# Contributing

**Your background and experience matter.**

We hired you at Stream because of the skills you bring to the team, and your perspective is important to us.

While we will often use the phrase "this isn't the only way, but this is Stream's way", the "Stream way" is not rigid and inflexible. If you have a tip, trick, or other ideas that you'd like the team to consider, **please do bring it to our attention**! You're part of the team, and your input is always welcome!

Getting Started

We have a "learning guide" contribution guide written and maintained here:

Please start by reading that guide, and reach out to Ian Douglas on Slack if you have additional questions.

To contribute a change, request edit access on Gitbook, and submit your changes. Merge them on Gitbook, which should create a branch on the Git repo. Next, discuss the changes with the team for a documentation review.

Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge and making us all better at our jobs!
